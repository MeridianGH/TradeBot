This is a Steam trading bot that operates with TF2 items. Currently it only trades with keys.
There are more items to come in the future. Maybe also a system to trade every item if the price is in the bots favor.

Disclaimers:
===
* This project heavily relies on the Python library [steampy](https://github.com/bukson/steampy) by [bukson](https://github.com/bukson).
I want to thank [bukson](https://github.com/bukson) for providing this library, which without it this project would be completely impossible!

* Also, the [backpack.tf](https://backpack.tf) website which provides the prices for items (currently only keys)
but without it I couldn't expand the bot's functionality.

* The [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) helps at dealing with trade offers and
using the Steam trading network
